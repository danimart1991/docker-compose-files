# Node-RED

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.

## Deployment

- Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Change the environment vars `${XXXXXX}` for your own. Example:

  ```yaml
  - TZ=${DOCKER_TZ}
  to
  - TZ=Europe/Madrid
  ```

- Modify the rest of the file with your own configuration.

- Then, deploy the service with `docker-compose up -d`.

## Tips

- Property `group_add` and volume `/var/run/docker.sock` are necessary if you want to control _Docker Containers_ inside _Node-RED_. You could obtain the `group_add` value using the command `grep /etc/group -e "docker"`.
