# Home Assistant

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) turns your [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) (or another device) into the ultimate home automation hub. With _Home Assistant_, you can focus on integrating your devices and writing automations.

## Deployment

- Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Change the environment vars `${XXXXXX}` for your own. Example:

  ```yaml
  - TZ=${DOCKER_TZ}
  to
  - TZ=Europe/Madrid
  ```

- Modify the rest of the file with your own configuration.

- Then, deploy the service with `docker-compose up -d`.

## Tips

- Do not try to combine Docker `restart` policies with host-level process managers (such as `systemd`), because this creates conflicts.
- Docker command line option `--net=host` or the compose file equivalent `network_mode: host` must be used to put Home Assistant on the hostâ€™s network, otherwise certain functionality (including _mDNS_ and _UPnP_) will break. The `-p` command line option or the compose file equivalent `ports:` is not compatible with host networking mode and must not be used.
- I include an extra volume (`${DOCKER_PATH_TEMPORARY}/home-assistant_tmp:/tmp`) where I include the database. I don't want to save the Home Assistant Database in my backups.

  You can use the [recorder integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) to change where the Database is saved:

  ```yaml
  recorder:
  db_url: sqlite:////tmp/home-assistant_v2.db
  ```
